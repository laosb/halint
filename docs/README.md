# `docs`

This directory contains the website at https://laosb.github.io/wright, which is introduced for
easier try-outs, documentations and more about this project.

## Run

Use any web server and serve this as the webroot.

## Build

After your modification to wright itself, you'll need to rebuild the `halint.b.min.js` in
`assets` to keep the website updated. All you need to do is just running `npm run prepublish`
**in the root of this repo**. This command is also the one does all preparations. If you're
contributing to this project, make sure you've executed the command before you commit and push.
